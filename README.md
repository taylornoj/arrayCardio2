# Array Cardio Day 2
Day 7 of #JS30 from the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

For the second round of array cardio, I decided to create a browser to show solutions of my code.

This challenge focused on the following methods:
- .some()
- .every()
- .find()
- .findIndex()

My favourite part of this project was using the spread operator and slice, to delete an element from an array
